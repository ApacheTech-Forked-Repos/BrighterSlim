Story: As an organizer I want to propose a session with a speaker so that I can begin finding a venue for it
Scenario
Given that I enter a session title
And a speaker name
When I save them to a proposal
Then my proposal will be added to the proposed session list

Given that I have a proposed session with a Title of "CQRS Diving Deeper" and a Speaker of "Ian Cooper"
And I have a proposed session with a Title of "Introduction to Mono" and a Speaker of "Toby Henderson"
When I view the proposed session index
Then I will see two proposed sessions
The first with a proposed session with a Title of "CQRS Diving Deeper" and a Speaker of "Ian Cooper"
And the second with a proposed session with a Title of "Introduction to Mono" and a Speaker of "Toby Henderson"

Scenario
Given that I have a proposed session
When I delete the session
Then it is removed from the proposed session list

--No real need to update a proposal I expect, we turn them in to sessions and speakers i.e. we have a proposal, we either match with existing speaker or create new, we match with existing venue details or create new. Proposal should be a lightweight pipeline.
