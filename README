Paramore is a collection of projects whose main purpose is to supplement talks or blog posts. I often find that both of these suffer from the lack of my ability to provide an example that attendees or readers can explore in more depth when the presentation is finished or they have read the blog post. So the code here is an attempt to solve that problem.

The individual projects may have some re-usable code; my intent is to harvest that and present it in a more re-usable form over time. Requests welcome, though no timescales guaranteed

Ignorance - Notionally this might be used to replace the very outdated London User Group site at www.dnug.org.uk However, there have been a lot of notional replacements of that over time, so no one should hold their breath. More pragmatically its trying to be an example of how to follow a DDD approach, and utilizing a simple CQRS pattern to help achieve that. Arguments about whether the domain is sufficiently high-value for a DDD approach are ignored in favor of the accessability of the sample. It's also using a few technologies I wanted to try out: Raven DB, NancyFX, and TinyIoC

Renegade - Just some older code, dumped here for now. At this point, nothing to see here, move along. Later this is intended to be a version of Ignorance that uses an Event Sourcing approach to storage.
