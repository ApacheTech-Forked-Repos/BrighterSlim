Paramore is a collection of projects whose main purpose is to supplement talks or blog posts. 

I often find that both of these suffer from the lack of my ability to provide an example that attendees 
or readers can explore in more depth when the presentation is finished or they have read the blog post. 
So the code here is an attempt to solve that problem.

The individual projects may have some re-usable code; my intent is to harvest that and present it in a 
more re-usable form over time. Requests welcome, though no timescales guaranteed

You can find more information on the projects over on the wiki
