** Allow setting of the connection retry interval and maximum retry window

To improve the resilience of client connections, RedisClient will transparently retry failed Redis operations due to 
Socket and I/O Exceptions in an exponential backoff starting from 10ms up until the RetryTimeout of 10000ms. 
These defaults can be tweaked with:

    RedisConfig.DefaultRetryTimeout = 10000;
    RedisConfig.BackOffMultiplier = 10;
    

**Acknowledge
We can do anything as we have already removed item from queue for competing consumers.We don't get to 'lock' a message
Would it help if we recorded unacked messages somehow i.e. messages that are locked, with a timeout?
So another queue has locked messages, we check if message is locked, if it is we move on
Lock has TTL so will fade if not used?
Might require batching or transaction to acquire and write lock?


XXXX TODO: WE CANT UPDATE THE HANDLED COUNT, UNLESS WE MODIFY THE MESSAGE STORED IN REDIS XXXXXX

** Delay
To support delay we want to implement a priority queue within Redis
This may actually help us with the issue of creating a generic priority queue i.e. send to Redis and then later forward 
via another producer if required. Should be a design goal, allows use of Redis as a 'hangfire' alternative


** Request/Response
We should support this, how? Look at RedisMQ

** Concerns
Running out of integers for message ids - we could roll over?
Running out of storage space for messages (TTL?) - code we need to cope with pulling a message that had expired
