Paramore

Explorations in Distributed .NET Architecture

Paramore is a proving ground for approaches to distributed development in .NET. It's main purpose is to support personal exploration, learning and teaching. It is possible to harvest some parts of Paramore for re-use within applications, however it is intended to be exemplary not re-useable.

The primary influences on the approaches here are:

Exploration of Architectural Styles
===  
* Hierachical Systems  
  * N-Tier inc. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) 
  * CQRS
* Data Centric Systems  
  * OO Domain Model (see below..  )
* Data Flow Systems  
  * Piplines
* Interacting Processess  
  * Broker
* Client-Server (REST, SPA)  


Exploration of Domain Modelling Techniques
===  
* Responsibility Driven Design  
* Domain Driven Design  
* Tell Don't Ask
