# Release Notes #

## Release 3 ##


1. Refactored **IAmAMessagingGateway** into a **IAmAMessageConsumer** and **IAmAMessageProducer** to support differing approaches to producing and consuming messages for a particular flavour of Message-Oriented-Middleware. *These changes are a breaking binary change for users of earlier versions.*
	1. NOTE: IF YOU USE TASK QUEUES PLEASE SAVE YOUR SERVICEACTIVATORCONNECTIONS IN YOUR APP.CONFIG AS THE V2.0.1 BRIGHTER.SERVICEACTIVATOR UNINSTALL WILL DELETE THEM (FIXED FOR V3)	
2. Created an **IAmAChannel** abstraction to allow differing Application Layer dependencies for the Work Queue
2. Upgraded Packages we depend on, including RabbitMQ. *There is still an issue with our having a hard dependency on a RabbitMQ client that might vary from your RabbitMQ client version, but as a NuGet package there are few workarounds. We suggest building from source where this issue is problematic, for now.*
3. Significant stability improvements on the RabbitMQ client
	1. Fixed issues around re-connection of the client leading to lost messages.
	2. Fixed issues when explicitly closing and re-opening connections
	3. Provided support for a **RequeueException** to requeue messages that are 'out-of-time' to help with resequencing.
	1. We now dispose of channels aggressively on closure, instead of waiting for garbage collection
2. Moved from [Common.Logging](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging) to [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog)  *These changes are a breaking binary change for users of earlier versions.*
3. We now call Release for all **RequestHandler<>** derived handlers that we construct from an **IAmAHandlerFactory**, not just those that implement IDisposable. 
4. Note that the RestMS server is **NOT** ready for production usage. It's primary value, as of today, is an alternative to RabbitMQ for design purposes. It is hoped to produce a stable version for use as a ControlBus in a future release.
